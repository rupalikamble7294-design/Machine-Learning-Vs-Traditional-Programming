# Machine-Learning-Vs-Traditional-Programming
Traditional programming uses predefined rules written by developers in languages like Java, where input and logic produce output. In Machine Learning, instead of fixed rules, we train a model using data. The model learns patterns and makes predictions on new data, making it suitable for complex and data-driven problems.
